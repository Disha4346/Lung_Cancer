# 🫁 Lung Cancer Detection using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

Early detection of lung cancer significantly improves treatment success and patient survival rates.  
This project leverages **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning (CNNs)** to analyze clinical data and CT-scan images for automated lung cancer prediction.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system provides two different approaches for diagnosis:

1️⃣ **Machine Learning model** using patient clinical parameters  
2️⃣ **CNN model** using CT-Scan images for direct cancer identification  

Both models serve as a decision-support system to assist healthcare professionals with faster and more accurate screening.

## 🌟 Key Features

✅ Multi-class lung cancer risk prediction (ML Model)  
✅ CT-Scan Tumor classification (CNN Model)  
✅ Streamlit Web Interface for real-time diagnosis  
✅ Simple & user-friendly UI  
✅ Accepts local image uploads for inference
